# rad GLSL
Little toy project. It's not an example of good code or anything, just something I bashed together and am putting here because want to deploy to netlify to farm epic reaccs from my friends.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
